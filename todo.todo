- Fix CSS:
    ✅ Dropdown same width as input
    ✅ Fix price range slider
        - Can't figure out why the div is not being rendered with the same children as in the instant demo
         (css and js is exactly the same?) --> something about the different version of instantsearch being imported?
- ✅ Create replicas -- just ended up hooking it back to the latency data set, but did create replicas
- ❎ Horizontal categories for autocomplete --> Decided against it to just go with query suggestions
- ✅ Change the source: provide a function that has cb that uses searchForFacetValues() 
    - Did that, but wouldn't it be better to have a separate index? 🤔 --> yes ✅
- ✅ Use query suggestions as a separate index
- ✅ Update input with selected suggestion
- ✅ Fix padding on dropdown
- ✅ Make widget configurable with the timeout delay

- Add query rules + banner -- for particular products? (e.g. apple, samsung landing pages)
    ✅ Read query rules docs and look at code for demo-query-rules https://github.com/algolia/demo-query-rules
    ✅ Select which query rules you would like to use for this data set
        - 1) 'best' <product> --> filters for products w/ 5 stars
        - 2) on 'video games' query promote guitar hero, cuz why not? (and they don't carry smash brothers)
        - 3) on 'free shipping' display a blinking annoying banner for 'free shipping' and filter results so only those with free shipping appear.
        - 4) on 'smartphone' display banners for apple and samsung 
        - 5) if a brand name is typed, filter on that and remove from query
    ✅  Set query rules programmatically 

- Create tutorial for custom widget + autocomplete, and for query rules

Styling:
✅ selection color: red
✅ padding around each item on the dropdown
✅ input element: remove thick border, 1px all around in grey, focus on red
✅  fake branding instead of 'instant search demo' (best buy knock off)
✅ on autocomplete, include banners inside of dropdown (example query for 'smartphone')

Features:
✅ Live input for delay time, for number of suggestions, number of columns -- css gridlayout? columns? --> might require a fixed height (might have to re-render all new instant search with param)

Bugs:
- IS not checking the filter though the filter is selected through query rules (example query "apple")


--------

- Re-factor // clean
- Come up with a better name
